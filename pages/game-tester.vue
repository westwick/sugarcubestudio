            Imagine the courage it takes to stand up against a system built on
            tyranny and oppression. Simurgh is that courage, brought to life. It
            is an unyielding and passionate tribute to the people of Iran, a
            game born from the deep desire to see their beautiful country
            finally free.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            This isn't just another mobile beat-'em-up. It's a statement. A
            declaration of war against the oppressive rulers who have held a
            nation captive. With stunning visuals and fluid, intense combat, you
            won't just be playing a gameâ€”you'll be part of a movement. Join the
            fight. Take control of Iran's destiny and become the hero a country
            so desperately needs. The battle for freedom starts now.
